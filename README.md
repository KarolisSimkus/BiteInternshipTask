### Preface
    Just before you look into the code, this is my first time using PHP. 
    Constructive criticism welcome :)

## Task Description:
1. Read a list of integers from the provided 'input.txt' file (one number per line)
2. Sort the list in ascending order
3. Create a simple web page that:
   - Processes the file and sorting logic on the backend using PHP
   - Displays the sorted list on a web page
   - Shows the highest number from the list in a form input
   - Implements functionality to increase or decrease this value by 5
   - Ensures the value cannot go below zero
   - Includes basic styling for readability

## Getting Started
1. Set up a local PHP environment (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc.)
2. Clone this repository to your web server's document root
3. Access the application via your local web server
