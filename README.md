## Preface
    Just before you look into the code, this is my first time using PHP. 
    Constructive criticism welcome :)

## Task Description:
1. Read a list of integers from the provided 'input.txt' file (one number per line)
2. Sort the list in ascending order
3. Create a simple web page that:
   - Processes the file and sorting logic on the backend using PHP
   - Displays the sorted list on a web page
   - Shows the highest number from the list in a form input
   - Implements functionality to increase or decrease this value by 5
   - Ensures the value cannot go below zero
   - Includes basic styling for readability

## Getting Started
1. Set up a local PHP environment (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc.)
2. Clone this repository to your web server's document root
3. Access the application via your local web server

## How It Works:
1. Reads from data.txt numbers and adds to an array
2. The array is sorted just using the sort() function
3. Lets you add/subtract 5 from the highest number ( only once:) )

## What this program is lacking:
- Correctness of the algorithm implementation
- Understanding of time/space complexity
- Proper use of PHP for backend processing
- Efficient implementation of the increment/decrement functionality
- Code organization and readability
- Error handling
